# One morning or one code?

I was asked to join a series of excel spreadsheets. I spent an entire morning to finish the task. Boring repetitive work. Open spreadsheet, copy, and glue.
That same week I could not contain myself. I created a code to join spreadsheets. Automating repetitive processes is critical nowadays.
